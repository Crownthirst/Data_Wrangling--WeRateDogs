### Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this project I used python and it's libraries to gather data from a variety of sources and in various formats to assess the data's quality and tidiness issues in the jupyter notebook found in this repository.
The wrangling process and resulting insights are documented in the Wrangle Report and Act Report also found in this repository.

# About Dataset
The dataset wrangled (analyzed and visualized) is the tweet archive of Twitter user [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates), also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Haha, Because they love dogs.
